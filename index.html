	<h1>What is it?</h1>
	Notable is a prototype for inline annotation styling for publishers.

	While bigger newsrooms like NYT and the Washington Post are working on using sophisticated ways towards building long form annotated content, smaller publications that don't have the developer/reporter hybrid residing in the newsroom, can't often build packages like that. 'Notable' is a project to fill that void. Inspired by the way Knight lab makes its open source tools accessible to journalists without core programming skills, it is powered by Google Spreadsheets - which though isn't a 'sustainable' solution (thanks to the Sheets API breaking so often!), it is still an 'accessible' solution.

	As a sample, I <a href="http://gurmanbhatia.com/notable/notable-resume.html" target = "_blank">annotated my CV using notable.</a> The project is still under development and the code can be found on <a href = "http://github.com/gurmanbh/notable" target="_blank">Github.</a>
	<h1>How to use it?</h1>
	Step 1: Create a Google spreadsheet with your content based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QdZCLbD_wPTe6szkDVM9MpKh-w0ubIUvVP44bhhDRdM/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">this template</a>.
	Step 2: Go to File -> Publish to the web and copy the link.
	Step 3: Paste the link below and hit submit. Notable generates embed codes for your story.
	Step 4: Insert the embed codes at appropriate portions of the story. And, Voila! You have an annotated story ready for you.
